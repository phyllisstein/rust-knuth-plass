        There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More
        lies. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? However,
        she mistook the drowsy eye alcohol warning for a winking eye alcohol
        suggestion. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the
        moisture. Everybody dance... NOW.

        I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? And
        THAT'S why you always leave a note. And I am rock steady. No more
        dizzies.

        I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice
        anything for my children. After all, why should you go to jail for a
        crime somebody else noticed?

    In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters
    were all beautiful; and the youngest was so beautiul that the sun itself, which
    has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the
    king's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest
    was a well, and when the day was very warm, the king's child went out into the
    forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain; and when she was bored she
    took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it; and this ball was her
    favorite plaything.
